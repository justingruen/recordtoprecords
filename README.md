# Things I don't understand:

1. The firebase config with .env
2. export withAuth from both Session/index and Session/withAuth and import into App/index
    which does it import from?
3. The specifics of how withFirebase(Component) works and that thing in Firebase/context.js
    ^^ and by proxy higher order components, although I think im starting to get it
4. Parts like 4-6 or something


# Things to do
1. Add way to delete account
2. Add local storage so password blocks on account page dont stutter
3. Check if it can send a conf email on the first go
